In one embodiment, the integer value of the OID is generated and then converted to a string for use in caching the object. In one embodiment, objects are not marked for deletion from the cache until a client calls a remove method. In one embodiment, object references in the cache include a reference to an exported object. In one embodiment, unexport of the exported object is performed by a post-invoke mechanism of the bridge mechanism after the remove method has completed.}
